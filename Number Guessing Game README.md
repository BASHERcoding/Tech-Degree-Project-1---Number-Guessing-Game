# Tech Degree Project 1 - Number Guessing Game


# This is my first tech degree project involving a number guessing game.
# When you play, a random number will be chosen and you'll be prompted to guess.
# Once you pick a number, the game will tell you to guess higher or lower, unless you got it right.
# The game will also provide your total number of guesses and ask if you'd like to play again.
# The game features a High Score if you play multiple times in a row.
# If you enter a word or numerical digit outside the 1-10 range, the game will prompt you to enter the correct information and play again.
# Enjoy the game :)
